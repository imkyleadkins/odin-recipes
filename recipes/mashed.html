<h1 id="perfect">The Perfect Filet Mignon</h1>
<p>This is the perfect way to cook Filet Mignon at home – simple, flavorful and absolutely juicy. 
    Great for Valentine’s Day or any time you want to make a special dinner!</p>
<h2 id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Filet Steaks</li>
    <li>Salt/Pepper</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Rosemary</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Steps">Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start by removing your Filet Mignons from the fridge about 30-60 minutes before cooking them. 
    Just unwrap them, place them on a plate, salt/pepper them and let them sit on the counter. 
    This is a major part in yielding tender, juicy steaks.</li>
<li>Once ready, heat the oven to 360°F and place a cast-iron skillet over high heat on your stove.

    Let it heat up well, then add the oil and sear your filet steaks without moving them until a 
    brown crust forms on the bottom and they easily release from the pan. Flip and sear/brown the other side in the same way.
    
    (They take about 2-3 minutes per side for 6-8oz steaks; 1-2 minutes for 4oz petite steaks).</li>
<li>Immediately take the pan off the heat, then add the butter, garlic and rosemary to the pan. 
    The butter will splatter and melt immediately. I like to baste the steaks with a few tablespoons 
    of the butter before adding them to the oven.</li>
<li>Place the skillet in the hot oven for 2-8 minutes, depending on how done you like your beef and 
    the exact size of your Filet Mignons. Mine took 3 minutes to cook to medium-rare.

    As a rule of thumb, 5 minutes will yield fillet steaks cooked to about medium. 3-4 minutes will 
    yield medium-rare fillet steaks. 2 minutes will yield rare fillet steaks. 6-7 minutes will yield 
    medium-well and 8 minutes well-done fillet steaks. The exact timing depends on your exact Filet Mignon weight and thickness.</li>
<li>Once done, you’ll want to remove the skillet from the oven. Remove the Filet Mignons to a plate, 
    tent with foil and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving with the butter and garlic from the pan.</li>
