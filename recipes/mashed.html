<h1>The Perfect Garlic Mashed Potatoes</h1>
<p>I’m not kidding when I say that these are the best mashed potatoes I’ve tried. 
They’re ultra-rich and blissfully creamy, and the sour cream gives them a delicious tangy kick. 
They’re easy to make (and make ahead!), and they’re guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser at Thanksgiving or any meal.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Unsalted butter</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Sour cream</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>    
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>First, peel and chop the potatoes. Cut them into large chunks—halve smaller 
    Yukon Golds and cut larger russets into quarters or sixths. Do your best to cut
     the pieces to a consistent size so that they cook evenly.</li>
<li>Next, cook. Place the potatoes and garlic in a large pot and cover with cold water
     by 1 inch. Add a tablespoon of salt, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. 
     Reduce the heat to medium and gently boil until the potatoes are fork-tender.</li>    
<li>When the potatoes are tender, drain them into a colander. Lightly shake to remove 
    excess water, and return the potatoes to the pot.</li>
<li>Finally, mash! Use a potato masher to partially mash the potatoes. T
    hen, pour in the milk and add the butter, salt, and pepper. 
    Continue mashing until the potatoes have reach your desired consistency 
    (we like them totally smooth!). If desired, use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir in the sour cream.

    Season to taste, adding more butter, sour cream, and salt and pepper as needed. Enjoy!</li>
